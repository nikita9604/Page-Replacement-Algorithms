## Page Faults by Page Replacement Algorithms using [Scilab](https://www.scilab.org/)

This is the Scilab Code solution to Problem 9.8, Chapter 9 - Virtual Memory, Operating System Concepts (Book) by Abraham Silberschatz.

### Problem 9.8:
Consider the following page reference string:

        1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 1, 2, 3, 7, 6, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 6.
How many page faults would occur for the following replacement algorithms, assuming one, two, three, four, five, six, and seven frames? Remember that all frames are initially empty, so your first unique pages will cost one fault each

  1. LRU replacement
  2. FIFO replacement
  3. Optimal replacement
